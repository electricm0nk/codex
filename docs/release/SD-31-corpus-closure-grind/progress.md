# SD-31 Progress Log

## Split from SD-30 (2026-08-14)

Package created by operator ruling 2026-08-14 ("split phase 3 and phase 4 into their own SD's; SD-31
and SD-32"). Epics 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and the grind-lane half of 14 moved from
`SD-30-class-feature-archetype-bundle/` (renumbered 1-6 here — see `epic-breakdown.md`'s map). No card
was `IN-FLIGHT` at split time (verified against SD-30's `kanban.md` immediately before the move); every
moved card carries forward as `READY`/`READY (gated on ...)`, state unchanged.

SD-30's own per-cycle receipts for this scope, recorded before the split, remain in
`SD-30-class-feature-archetype-bundle/progress.md` as history — not copied here. Cycles claiming a card
in this package's `kanban.md` from this point forward append their receipts below.

No cycles claimed yet.

## 2026-08-15 — Launch-readiness remediation Step 1: S1-doneness-bar (RETRO_ACTOR sd31-ready-s1)

**Scope.** Plan Step 1 of
`~/.claude/plans/conduct-a-launch-readines-zesty-ripple.md` — blockers B1/B3. Landed Decision 5 (the
mandate denominator, operator ruling 2026-08-15) in `decisions.md`; the doneness bar in
`epic-breakdown.md` Epic 9-F1 and the Completion gate; `AT-31-103` in
`acceptance-and-verification.md`; relabelled `AT-31-005`'s `done+held` floors as progress floors, not
closure criteria; updated the exit gate checklist; updated `README.md` Purpose/Exit statement to name
the doneness bar. Doc-only step — no Rust/Python/shell production code touched.

**Started from HEAD** `56512485cbd89594c832e976c18e47adf1820987` on `tranche/10`. Tree was clean at
start (`git status --porcelain` empty); confirmed before any write.

**Figures re-derived this cycle (every one reproduced, not transcribed):**

1. Strict mandate denominator/doneness (command in `AT-31-103`, `decisions.md §5`):
   ```
   python3 -c "import json,sys,collections; sys.path.insert(0,'scripts/observer'); import
   pf1e_dashboard_producer as P; U=[u for u in json.load(open('docs/work-inventory.json'))['units'] if
   u.get('book') not in P.EXCLUDED_BOOKS]; c=collections.Counter(P.doneness_verdict(u.get('wiring_class'),
   u.get('status'),u.get('kind')) for u in U); print(c, len(U))"
   ```
   → `Counter({'not-started': 20895, 'held': 6916, 'done': 5837, 'unmeasurable': 3989,
   'in-progress': 848, 'deferred': 36}) 38521`. **done=5,837, denominator=38,521, 15.15 %** — matches
   the plan's expected figure exactly.
2. Old/secondary headline (in-scope books only, minus `unmeasurable`/`deferred`, replaying the live
   dashboard's `inScopeUnits()`/`usableDenom()` logic from `~/swarm-observer/PF1e-dashboard.html` over
   `docs/work-inventory.json`'s `books[].scope == "in_scope"`):
   ```
   python3 -c "
   import json, sys, collections
   sys.path.insert(0,'scripts/observer')
   import pf1e_dashboard_producer as P
   d = json.load(open('docs/work-inventory.json'))
   in_scope_ids = {b['id'] for b in d['books'] if b.get('scope') == 'in_scope'}
   U = [u for u in d['units'] if u.get('book') in in_scope_ids]
   c = collections.Counter(P.doneness_verdict(u.get('wiring_class'), u.get('status'), u.get('kind')) for u in U)
   denom = len(U) - c['unmeasurable'] - c['deferred']
   print(c, 'denom', denom, 'pct', round(c['done']/denom*100,2))
   "
   ```
   → `done=5,837, denom=30,402, pct=19.20` — matches the plan's cited B3 figure exactly, and confirms
   the source of the 30,402/19.20% figure is the book-level `scope` field (30 `in_scope` of 38 books;
   7 `future_state`, 1 `out_of_scope` = `beginner_box`).
3. Book-scope roster: `Counter({'in_scope': 30, 'future_state': 7, 'out_of_scope': 1})` — 38 total
   books, 37 non-`beginner_box`, matching the operator ruling's "37 non-`beginner_box` books" text
   exactly.
4. Invariance check: the 7 `future_state` books already carry **4,094 units** inside
   `docs/work-inventory.json` today (`adventurers_guide`, `inner_sea_faiths`, `inner_sea_magic`,
   `inner_sea_taverns`, `inner_sea_temples`, `mythic_adventures`, `occult_adventures`) — confirms
   Epic 7 onboarding those books moves units toward `done` inside the existing 38,521 denominator,
   never widens it.

**Not independently re-derived this cycle:** the reachable-ceiling figure (36,412/38,521 = 94.53 %)
cited in `decisions.md §5` from the readiness plan's blocker B1 — `scripts/reachability_audit.py` is
Epic 0's own not-yet-built deliverable (explicitly out of scope for this pass, per the plan's
"Explicitly NOT in this pass"), so that figure is carried by source citation, not reproduced by me this
cycle. Flagged, not silently presented as re-derived.

**Retro.** One correction emitted for the denominator ambiguity
(`docs/retro/events/sd31-ready-s1.jsonl`, event id `1786802682843-sd31-ready-s1-51d39b`):
subject "SD-31 exit gate / AT-31-102 (pre-remediation)", claimed 30,402 vs actual 38,521 as the binding
mandate denominator, `--verified-by` the two commands above. No standalone `retro.py decision` event —
`decisions.md §5` itself is that record, dated and attributed.

**Verification.** Doc-only step; ran `./scripts/verify.sh --only preflight-disk` only, per the step
brief (no Rust/Python/shell production code changed):
```
==> preflight-disk — disk budget check before any build starts
    repo filesystem (/home/ubuntu/workspace/repos/codex, mounted at /): 40% used, 580G available
    scratch-log filesystem (/tmp/codex-verify-DsNt8Z, mounted at /): 40% used, 580G available
    PASS  preflight-disk  (disk budget OK)
SUMMARY
  passed:  1  preflight-disk
RESULT: PASS
```
`VERIFY_EXIT=0`.

**Files changed:** `decisions.md` (+Decision 5), `epic-breakdown.md` (Epic 9-F1 + Completion gate gain
the doneness bar), `acceptance-and-verification.md` (+AT-31-103, AT-31-005 relabelled, exit checklist
updated), `README.md` (Purpose/Exit statement name the doneness bar), `docs/retro/events/sd31-ready-s1.jsonl`
(+1 correction event), this file.

**Status:** complete for this step's stated scope. Steps 2-6 of the plan (cards for unowned kinds,
oracle pin, dashboard import, drift sweep, pre-launch checklist) are separate steps, not owned by this
receipt.
