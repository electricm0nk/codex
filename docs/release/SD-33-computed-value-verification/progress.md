# SD-33 Progress

Live cycle-by-cycle record. Cycles **prepend** their entry (newest first) and update `kanban.md` in the same commit, via `workflow-instruction.md §5`'s retry protocol.

## Status

**Not launched, not yet dispatched.** All three launch gates passed 2026-08-25 (`technical-requirements.md §1`, `workflow-instruction.md §1`):

1. SD-32's closure PR merged to `develop` — PR #376 MERGED, `origin/develop` = `f53b8e32da`
2. SD-32's instrument debt closed **inside SD-32** — 29 total / 0 open deferrals, `EXCLUDED_BOOKS = frozenset()`
3. `tranche/13` cut from `develop` and pushed — `origin/tranche/13` = `f652db7ac7`

**Cards complete: 0 / 21.**

## Cycle entry schema

Each entry states, at minimum:

- criterion ID and card number
- commit SHA(s)
- **every figure with the command that produces it and its denominator** (`decisions.md §2`)
- **movement in four buckets** — closure / reclassification / reachability / instrument-correction
- receipt path

## Open blockers

None. **This section is not a parking lot.** An entry here is a request for an operator ruling and it **pauses the bundle** (`../../governance/blocker-closure-doctrine.md`). It is never a disposition, never a closure path, and no later cycle may proceed past a blocked card on its own authority.

## Cycles

_None yet._
