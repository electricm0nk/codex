# SD-35 Progress

Live cycle-by-cycle record. Cycles **prepend** their entry (newest first) and update
`kanban.md` in the same commit, via `workflow-instruction.md §5`'s retry protocol.

Every cycle entry carries, verbatim from its receipt: the `cycle_scope_gate.py --min 500` line,
the `--receipt` rows (closed / relabeled / rust_lines_changed / ratio / builds_recorded /
pcgen_live_files), and the refused-token remainder. **An entry without the scope-gate line is a
process defect** recorded by the epic wrap-up.

## Open blockers

*(none — an entry here pauses the bundle and is a request for an operator ruling;
`decisions.md §6`)*

Corpus at the `tranche/15` cut (2026-09-07, `4c6c57eb9f`, identical to authoring at `5f6b18f4e3`):
`DONE=26123 of 49438`; non-DONE 23,315 of 49,438. Live-side PCGen residue at authoring: 78 files by coarse grep
(`content-unit-inventory.md §6`); the exact baseline is AT-35-E1-005's first run. Both
re-measured at the cut by the launch-readiness audit.

## Cycle log

### 2026-09-07 — AT-35-E1-001 cycle 1 — `batch-floor-gate` — complete

- **Scope gate:** `SCOPE_GATE: EXEMPT (gate-building cycle — this cycle CREATES cycle_scope_gate.py; it closes zero units by design, decisions.md §2)`
- **Receipt rows:** `closed=0 relabeled=0 rust_lines_changed=0 ratio=n/a builds_recorded=0 pcgen_live_files=unavailable` (`pcgen_residue_gate.py` not yet in the tree — AT-35-E1-005)
- **Refused tokens:** none
- **Landed:** `scripts/cycle_scope_gate.py` (floor + `--receipt`), `scripts/tests/test_cycle_scope_gate.py` (51 cases), `verify.sh` stage `cycle-scope-gate-selftest` (stage count 40 → 41; `scripts/verify.sh --list`). Live at HEAD: `--bucket B --kind class_feature` → `scoped=7866 remaining_non_done=23315 verdict=PASS`; `--bucket A --kind companion` → `scoped=28 ... FAIL_UNDER_FLOOR` exit 1 (`python3 scripts/cycle_scope_gate.py --min 500 ...`).
- **Found, not fixed (outside file-touch set):** `denominator_gate.py --check` on the package is `violations=11` of `files_checked=21`, all in 4 pre-launch `artifacts/epic-2-sheet-rule/token-mapping/*.md` files — retro incident `denominator-gate-red-on-package-prose`; owner AT-35-E1-004.
- **Receipt:** `artifacts/epic-1-tax-cut/AT-35-E1-001_cycle1_receipt.md` — code at `1d821cdc8d`.
