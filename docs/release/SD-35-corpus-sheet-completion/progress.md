# SD-35 Progress

Live cycle-by-cycle record. Cycles **prepend** their entry (newest first) and update
`kanban.md` in the same commit, via `workflow-instruction.md §5`'s retry protocol.

Every cycle entry carries, verbatim from its receipt: the `cycle_scope_gate.py --min 500` line,
the `--receipt` rows (closed / relabeled / rust_lines_changed / ratio / builds_recorded /
pcgen_live_files), and the refused-token remainder. **An entry without the scope-gate line is a
process defect** recorded by the epic wrap-up.

## Open blockers

*(none — an entry here pauses the bundle and is a request for an operator ruling;
`decisions.md §6`)*

Corpus at the `tranche/15` cut (2026-09-07, `4c6c57eb9f`, identical to authoring at `5f6b18f4e3`):
`DONE=26123 of 49438`; non-DONE 23,315 of 49,438. Live-side PCGen residue at authoring: 78 files by coarse grep
(`content-unit-inventory.md §6`); the exact baseline is AT-35-E1-005's first run. Both
re-measured at the cut by the launch-readiness audit.
