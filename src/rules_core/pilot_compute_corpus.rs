//! SD-19 corpus-aware compute seam.
//!
//! Wraps [`compute_pilot_base_chassis`] with corpus-derived spell-school
//! and equipment contributions, without modifying `pilot_compute.rs`
//! itself — every landed SD-18 cycle keeps calling the chassis function
//! unchanged. See
//! `programs/codex/requirements/SD-19-corpus-aware-compute-seam/technical-design.md`
//! §1 for the design.
//!
//! This module's own `Pf1SchoolId`/`RuleSetId` types come from `rules_tables`
//! (the SD-19 foundation slice); `PilotReceipt` in the doctrine doc's
//! illustrative code does not exist in this repo — the real chassis
//! function returns `PilotBaseChassisComputation`, which is what `base`
//! wraps here.
//!
//! Resolution here is deliberately **generic**: it reads a resolved
//! corpus record's own school/category rather than dispatching through
//! per-school/per-category files (operator-confirmed 2026-07-16, see the
//! review note atop `technical-design.md`). This satisfies the
//! seam-shapes-correctness proof at slice-ship, before any loop cycle has
//! landed. Future SD-19 cycles ground *evidence tier* (matrix row
//! promotion, exhaustive per-school/category coverage) rather than
//! writing new dispatch code.
